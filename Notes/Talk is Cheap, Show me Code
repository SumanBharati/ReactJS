PROPS - These are short form for properties.
As we know functional components are nothing but JS functions, thus props are arguments to our function.
When we want to pass some dynamic data between components we pass them as props. 
Whenever we are passing some arguments from one component, raect wrap these data into an object and it gets passed to other component. And we can access them as {props.argumentName}.

CONFIG DRIVEN UI: 

KEY: 
not using keys (not acceptable) <<<<<< indexs as keys <<<<<< unique ids (best practice)
