Assignment Questions:

1) What are the various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.

2) What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
It will log an array containing 2 element, first will be a undefined variable and second will be a function.

3) How will useEffect behave if we don't add a depedency array?
If dependency array is not present at all, useEffect will be called everytime after the component renders, 
or re-renders.

4) What is SPA?
Its a single page, just the components getting interchanged via client-side routing.

5) What is difference between Client side routing and Server side routing?
- Client Side Routing: Here we don't make any network call, the information is already present as all the 
components are already loaded inside our application when we load the page and when we want to navigate 
between pages only that components loads, we are not fetching any page here.
- Server Side Routing: Here we make network calls and the information is returned from the server to us 
resulting in the page refresh when data comes and fills in the application.
